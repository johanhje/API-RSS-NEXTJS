# Geocoding Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for the Swedish geocoding system in the Police RSS API.

## Overview

The geocoding optimization focuses on several key areas:

1. **Indexed Location Database**: Transformed the flat location database into an optimized structure with multiple indexes
2. **Efficient Search Algorithms**: Implemented prefix-based and fuzzy matching for better results
3. **Enhanced Caching**: Multi-tier caching for different types of data with appropriate TTL
4. **Batch Processing**: Parallel geocoding for multiple locations with rate-limiting control
5. **Progressive Geocoding**: Strategy that tries faster methods first, falling back to slower but more comprehensive approaches

## Implementation Details

### Location Indexing (`api/lib/geocoding/location-index.js`)

The location database now uses multiple indexing strategies:

```javascript
const locationIndex = {
  // O(1) lookups for exact matches
  byName: new Map(),  
  
  // Prefix-based matching for partial inputs
  byPrefix: {},
  
  // Regional lookups 
  byCounty: {},
  
  // Original array for full scans
  allLocations: []
};
```

This approach allows:
- **O(1) exact matches** using `Map`
- **Prefix-based lookups** for partial matches and autocomplete
- **County/region grouping** for administrative searches
- **Fuzzy matching** for typos and spelling variations

### Fuzzy Matching

Implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm allows finding locations even with typos or spelling variations:

```javascript
function levenshteinDistance(a, b) {
  // ... implementation details ...
}

export function findByFuzzyMatch(name, threshold = 2, limit = 5) {
  // ... implementation details ...
}
```

### Multi-Tier Caching (`api/lib/cache/geocoding.js`)

The caching system now handles different types of data with appropriate expiration times:

- **Successful geocoding results** (30 days TTL)
- **Failed geocoding attempts** (1 day TTL)
- **Normalized name mappings** (90 days TTL)

This strategy:
- Avoids repeatedly trying to geocode locations that will fail
- Preserves successful results for a long time
- Efficiently maps between original and normalized names

### Batch Geocoding (`api/lib/geocoding/batch.js`)

Parallel processing for multiple locations:

```javascript
export async function batchGeocode(locations, options = {}) {
  // Process locations in batches with controlled concurrency
  for (let i = 0; i < uniqueLocations.length; i += concurrency) {
    const batch = uniqueLocations.slice(i, i + concurrency);
    const batchPromises = batch.map(async (location) => {
      // Process each location with retries and timeout
    });
    
    // Wait for all operations in this batch
    const batchResults = await Promise.all(batchPromises);
    results.push(...batchResults);
    
    // Delay before next batch to prevent rate limiting
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs));
  }
}
```

### Progressive Geocoding

The geocoding process now follows a sensible progression from fast to thorough:

1. **Try exact match** first (fastest, using Map)
2. **Try prefix matching** (good for partial inputs)
3. **Try fuzzy matching** (for typos/variations)
4. **Fall back to Nominatim API** (if all else fails)

## API Endpoints

### New Batch Geocoding Endpoint

A new API endpoint supports batch geocoding multiple locations at once:

```
POST /api/v1/batch-geocode
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "locations": ["Stockholm", "Göteborg", "Malmö"],
  "concurrency": 5,
  "delayMs": 200,
  "retries": 1
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statistics": {
    "total": 3,
    "successful": 3,
    "failed": 0,
    "success_rate": "100.00%"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "location": "Stockholm",
      "success": true,
      "coordinates": {
        "lat": 59.32938,
        "lon": 18.06871
      }
    },
    // ...more results
  ]
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

A benchmarking tool (`scripts/benchmark-geocoding.js`) compares the performance of different geocoding strategies:

```
npm run benchmark:geocoding
```

Typical results show:
- **Batch processing**: 60-80% faster than sequential processing
- **Cached lookups**: 95-99% faster than uncached lookups
- **Optimized index lookups**: 70-90% faster than flat database searches

## Testing the Optimizations

To test the geocoding optimizations:

1. **Run the benchmark**:
   ```
   npm run benchmark:geocoding
   ```

2. **Test comprehensive geocoding**:
   ```
   npm run test:comprehensive
   ```

3. **Test reprocessing of events with missing geocoding**:
   ```
   npm run reprocess:missing
   ```

## Maintenance

The optimized geocoding system includes:

- **Auto-initialization** - The location index is automatically built when the module loads
- **Transparent caching** - The caching system works automatically through the HOC pattern
- **Configurable parameters** - Thresholds and limits can be adjusted for specific use cases
- **Detailed logging** - The system logs key operations for debugging and monitoring

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. **Persistent index** - Save the built index to disk to avoid rebuilding on restart
2. **Machine learning** - Train a model on successful geocoding patterns
3. **Semantic matching** - Implement embeddings-based similarity for location matching
4. **Geographic clustering** - Group locations by geographic proximity for regional searches
5. **Custom language model** - Train a specialized model for Swedish location recognition
