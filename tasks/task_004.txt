# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Swedish Location Database
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive database of Swedish locations including cities, municipalities, counties, and tourist destinations with their coordinates.
# Details:
1. Create a JSON structure for storing location data:
   ```javascript
   {
     "locations": [
       {
         "name": "Stockholm",
         "type": "city",
         "county": "Stockholm",
         "latitude": 59.3293,
         "longitude": 18.0686,
         "aliases": ["Stockholms stad", "Stockholms kommun"]
       },
       // More locations...
     ]
   }
   ```
2. Compile a list of 900+ Swedish locations including:
   - All major cities
   - All municipalities
   - All counties
   - Popular tourist destinations
   - Special focus on Kronoberg county locations
3. Include normalized versions of location names to handle variations
4. Add police-specific location formats and abbreviations
5. Implement a utility to load and search this database efficiently
6. Create a mechanism to update the location database over time

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all major Swedish cities are included
2. Test location lookup with various formats and spellings
3. Validate coordinates against known correct values
4. Test special case handling for Kronoberg county locations
5. Benchmark search performance with large datasets
